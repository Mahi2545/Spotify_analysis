# Spotify_analysis

Project Objective:
In this project, we analyze Spotify music data using Python to uncover insights about song attributes, artists, and user listening behaviors. By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), we aim to identify patterns in music preferences, the relationship between different song features (like tempo, danceability, and acousticness), and trends over time. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights into the music industry and consumer listening habits.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project consists of a collection of Spotify songs and their associated features, such as:

Song Name: The title of the song.
Artist: The artist who performed the song.
Genre: The musical genre of the song.
Popularity: How popular the song is based on the number of listens.
Danceability: How suitable a song is for dancing, scored from 0 to 1.
Energy: The energy level of the song, scored from 0 to 1.
Tempo: The speed of the song in beats per minute (BPM).
Acousticness: A measure of the song’s acoustic properties, from 0 to 1.
Loudness: The overall loudness of the song in decibels (dB).
Valence: The musical positiveness of the song, scored from 0 to 1.
 
Data Source:
The dataset is publicly available from Spotify's API or other online repositories and provides comprehensive metadata about millions of tracks in Spotify's library.
